  <h1>Employee Salary Prediction</h1>

   <h2>📌 Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict an employee's salary based on various attributes such as age, education, occupation, and hours worked per week. This can assist HR departments in analyzing salary trends and making informed hiring decisions.</p>

   <h2>🔧 System Development Approach</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technology Used:</strong> Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-learn</li>
        <li><strong>Libraries Required:</strong> pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn</li>
    </ul>

   <h2>⚙️ Algorithm & Deployment</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Load and explore the dataset (CSV format)</li>
        <li>Preprocess data (encoding categorical values)</li>
        <li>Split data into training and testing sets</li>
        <li>Train a Linear Regression model</li>
        <li>Evaluate performance using metrics like R² Score and MAE</li>
        <li>Visualize predictions vs actuals</li>
    </ol>

   <h2>📊 Result</h2>
    <p>The model was successfully trained and achieved an R² score of approximately 0.74 on the test set, showing good predictive performance.</p>

  <h2>✅ Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project demonstrates the application of linear regression in predicting real-world salaries based on employee features. With more features and a larger dataset, the accuracy can further improve.</p>

  <h2>🔮 Future Scope</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Deploy model using Streamlit or Flask</li>
        <li>Integrate more complex models like Random Forest or XGBoost</li>
        <li>Include additional real-world data such as location or experience</li>
    </ul>
